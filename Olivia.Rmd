```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
library(Biostatistics)
library(mosaic)
```

```{r}
codefield <- read_excel("Agriculture Data/DataS1.xlsx", 1)
#Explanations of all the variables used for data analyses at the field scale (for plants, invertebrates, frogs, and fish).

fieldscale <- read_excel("Agriculture Data/DataS1.xlsx", 2)
#Data on biodiversity and environmental factors used for data analyses at the field scale (for plants, invertebrates, frogs, and fish).

codeblock <- read_excel("Agriculture Data/DataS1.xlsx", 3)
